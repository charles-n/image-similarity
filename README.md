# image-similarity

These similarity clusters were created through R using the color histogram method across the rgb color cube.  Unfortunately; my Rscript is unavailable, and I plan to return in the future with a recreated copy.  These html files are to help illustrate the output and may be downloaded/loaded into your web browser for viewing purposes.

The following might require forking htmlpreview.github, and should render the html in chrome or mozilla:
